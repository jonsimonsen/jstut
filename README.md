Project for going through a js tutorial (https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-an-interactive-website)  

It's uncertain if this will produce any interesting results.  
I'm mainly doing this while taking a break from the other JS-project to try to better understand how to use Javascript/JQuery etc.  

This project will probably not be of great interest for the public.

-Did the first part of the tutorial  
-Copied the code for the second part.  
-Had to fix an issue related to the jumbotron to get it to display as intended locally.
