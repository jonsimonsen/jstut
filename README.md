# jstut
Project for going through a js tutorial (https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-an-interactive-website)  

It's uncertain if this will produce any interesting results.  
I'm mainly doing this while taking a break from the other JS-project to try to better understand how to use Javascript/JQuery etc.  

This project will probably not be of great interest for the public.  

v 0.1
-----

-Did the first part of the tutorial  
-Copied the code for the second part.  
-Had to fix an issue related to the jumbotron to get it to display as intended locally.  

Resources

css  
-Web-safe fonts: https://www.cssfontstack.com/  
-Other box-model: * { box-sizing: border-box;}

-JS documentation(string): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype  
-Use === or !== in comparisons.  
-functions can be defined as constants: const fName = (arg1, arg2...) => {fcode...};  
-variables defined as: let vName = vexpression;  
-Is a certain value present in an array: array.includes(value);
